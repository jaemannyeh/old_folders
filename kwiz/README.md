Hi there! Welcome to kwiz!

To get you started with C/C++, I have created some small applications
and a Makefile.

Have a look at the files, and use the terminal to build them:

    $ sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
    
    $ make
    $ ./bin/hello-c-world
    $ ./bin/hello-cpp-world

I'm sure you can take it from there. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add some new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
The kwiz team
